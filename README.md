# MathPlusPlus
A personal project dedicated to implementing some math concepts. Currently implemented, with some unit tests, are:

* Vectors (as in linear algebra) 
* Matrices (as in linear algebra)
* Complex Numbers - arithmetic, conjugation

I did not use the C++ `std::vector` class to practice with dynamic memory issues.
